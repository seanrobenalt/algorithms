**Algorithm** - A set of steps for a computer program to accomplish a task.

- Used to solve a problem and do so efficiently.

**Linear search** - on an array of *n* elements, might have to make as many as *n* guesses.

eg.

```javascript
  var doLinearSearch = function(array) {
    for (var guess = 0; guess < array.length; guess++) {
      if (array[guess] === targetValue) {
        return guess; // found what you were looking for
      }
    }
    return -1; // didn't find what you were looking for
  }
```

**Binary search** - looking for a target by halving the search portion. For example, you are searching an array of 32 elements, your first guess should be 16. If you are incorrect, you have just reduced your search portion by half.

**base-2 logarithm of** *n* - written as lg *n* - the number of times we repeatedly halve, starting at *n*, until we get the value of 1.

eg.

*n* | lg *n*
--- | ---
1 | 0
2 | 1
4 | 2
8 | 3
16 | 4
32 | 5
64 | 6
128 | 7
256 | 8
512 | 9
1024 | 10
1,048,576 | 20
2,097,152 | 21

**Asymptotic Analysis** - allows algorithms to be compared independently of programming language or system. Compare rate of growth with size of input. Constant factors and low-order terms don't tell us about the rate of growth of running time so they can be dropped when determining speed.

**big-Theta of** *n* - When we say a running time is Î˜(n), we are saying that once *n*
gets large enough, we increase *n* by a constant. We are saying we have an **asymptotically
tight bound** on the running time, because it matters for only large values of *n*. Tight bound because we've nailed the running time to within a constant factor above and below.

**Constant growth** - A function has constant growth if its output does not change based on the input, the *n*. (find those that have no *n* in their expression)

**Linear growth** - A function has linear growth if its output increases linearly with the size of *n*. (find those where *n* is never raised to a power, 1 being the exception)

**Polynomial growth** - A function has polynomial growth if its output increases according to a polynomial expression. (find those where *n* is raised to a constant power)

**Exponential growth** - A function has exponential growth if its output increases according to an exponential expression. (find those where a constant is raised to some expression involving *n*)

**Linearithmic functions** - those that multiply linear terms by a logarithm. Lesser bases grow more quickly than higher bases.

Rate of growth for these types:

1. Constant functions
2. Logarithmic functions
3. Linear functions
4. Linearithmic functions
5. Polynomial functions
6. Exponential functions

eg.

Slowest growing | - | - | - | - | Fastest growing
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | *n* | *n*^2 | *n*^3 | (3/2)^*n* | 2^*n*

## Binary Search

Write a program that takes an array and a target value, and searches the array for the target value.

## Exercise In Sorting

Visualize the swapping strategy of selection sort.

Write a program that takes an array of integers and step-by-step swaps each integer until the array is sorted in ascending order. Create a visualization of this that shows how each step sorted the integer.
